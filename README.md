1.  Singly linked list - linked_list.py
	- 	Insert node to list
		- Insert node at the beginning of the list
        - Insert node at the end of the list
        - Insert node at particular position in the list
    - 	Delete node from list
		- Delete node from the beginning of the list
        - Delete last node from the list
        - Delete node from particular position
        - Delete value from the list
    - 	Display list
    - 	Search node in list
    - 	Clear list
    - 	Exit
	
2.  Doubly linked list - doubly_linked_list.py
	- 	Insert node to list
		- Insert node at the beginning of the list
